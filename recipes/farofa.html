            <li>1 large onion</li>
            <li>1 strand of olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>1 cup seasoned cassava flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the onion into very thin slices (in the shape of a "half moon", as in the image), so you can brown it without burning too fast.</li>

            <li>Then heat a pan with a generous drizzle of oil and add the butter. <em>Tip: It is important to also use olive oil in this crispy farofa recipe because it prevents the butter from burning while it heats up.</em></li>

            <li>Fry the onion slowly , stirring constantly, until it has a caramelized appearance, as shown in the image. This is the ideal spot for the onion to be. <em>Tip: It is important to use the fire very low and do not stop stirring, because if the onion burns, it can become bitter.</em></li>

            <li>Add the seasoned cassava flour and continue stirring. Let the cassava flour sauté together with the caramelized onion for a few minutes, so your farofa will be crunchier!</li>
